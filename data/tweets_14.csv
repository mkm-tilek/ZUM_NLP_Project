This week we‚Äôve reached a crucial milestone in our growth: 

I moved our data to a centralised database with the aim of making things easier for our hero-team of volunteers and streamlining our workflows with one goal in mind:

‚ÄúEfficiently deliver humanitarian aid to as many people as possible‚Äù

üìπ 1: Sample of cases from our pharmacy department.

üìπ 2: List of pharmacies that has insulin, specific medications, etc. [compiled manually as we solved cases one-by-one]

üìπ 3: Medical needs SOS cases bird-eye view sorted by location, type of insulin in demand, etc. [this helps me predict where we would need ‚Äúemergency kits‚Äù the most]

This is just the beginning - system will be ‚Äúaesthetically pleasing‚Äù soon enough! üòÖ

Despite the fact that we now control a small part of Bakhmut, the importance of its defense does not lose its relevance. This gives us the opportunity to enter the city in case of a change in the situation. And it will definitely happen.

We continue to advance on the flanks in the suburbs of Bakhmut and are actually approaching the capture of the city in a tactical encirclement. Thanks to this, we will be able to control all high-rise buildings occupied by the enemy and gradually destroy them. This deprives the enemy of control over the approaches to the city and gives us certain tactical advantages.

In the course of working with the commanders, we discussed in detail our actions and the procedure for destroying the enemy. Therefore, we continue the defense. The situation is difficult, but under control.",

Chaudhary450991,"US had long planned war on European front where she could manage the European block and continue its hegemony in global trade & power. European Union was a direct threat to American hegemony hence war was imminent. Now the Americans were beating the war drums since 2014 Crimean war. Direct involvement in the war could pitch US against Russia and that is what they wanted to avoid. Hence they came up with a brilliant plan to turn towards their trusted and time tested hired guns and imran khan‚Äôs tilt towards Russia China Alliance made it difficult for US to manage hence regime change operation was carried out. Now khan is out and a victim of the attrocities and oppression. We are selling arms and ammunition to Ukraine for dollars under the table. Where are those dollars going if not in the economy. Pmln is opportunist, saw an opening and pounced on it. They are corrupt to the core and every body knows it but since they are a party to under the table weapons for dollars deal their crimes are being ignored. Trying pti leadership and workers in military courts is a matter which pmln will dearly repent on in the near future. The deep state is ignoring them at the moment but they will be the eventual victims of it.

If our budget STAYS THE SAME for the following year, it‚Äôs considered a budget CUT.

There is a long list of fiscal waste that we as taxpayers pay for. I‚Äôve seen it first hand.

When I was in the Navy (public affairs), in order for us to receive the same funding as the previous year, we were forced to buy things that we didn‚Äôt need in order to receive the same funding the next year.

So what did I do? Ordered a $700 office chair (not needed), buy dozens of expensive pens (not needed), and other ridiculous items.

AMLO, the Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has been denouncing and asking diplomatically and in the media, that the US stay away from Mexican politics and stop financing shock and coup movements in Politics and National Media, and as an example, he gives the USAID agency in Mexico, which through the American Embassy in Mexico has been financing shock groups that, disguised as political groups, meddle in the base projects of the Lopez Obrador six-year term, first meddling in the closure of the expensive Pe√±a Nieto's Airport, later sponsoring media that paints the image of AMLO as a 'communist and tyrant who only wants to subdue the people to fulfill his personal fantasies'.

It is clear that the US, with its Monroe doctrine, only tries to manipulate and redirect the course of the neighboring country, which as a backyard ""should only be led"" to where the 3-letter Agencies of the American government decide to lead it, for which reason social leaders such as AMLO meddles and breaks with the subjugation scheme of the backyard, to all of this, do the Americans know?

WHO WILL BE THE WINNER OF THIS BATTLE ROYALE ?

Agha Sorash Kashmiri
                      
                 He is at peace only, when he‚Äôs at war. He is a natural fighter . Imran khan is more likely to be the winner. Here is why?
 Battle Royale is a fight participated by more than two combatants. The last fighter standing, is declared the winner. 9th May, and the following few days, witnessed the state coming down hardest, with it‚Äôs full and fearsome might, on Imran Khan and the PTI. The shock and awe of this blitzkrieg was to ensure complete demolition of both. It is 11 long days, that have passed since. Imran Khan and his party have survived, albeit battered than bruised. Imran khan stood up in no time, dusting off his clothes,  regaining his balance. He even launched a counteroffensive,  announcing a public meeting the next day, forcing his opponents onto the defensive. There is no clear winner in this round, and that is the success of Imran Khan. He continues to be present in the ring and his being ready to carry on fighting is a very powerful message, not lost to his adversaries. Plan A has not worked. More importantly, nothing seems to be working.
     Pakistanis are transfixed by this captivating dual being fought in front of their eyes. There was an element of inevitability about this. For quite some time, the belligerents were sizing up each other and strengthening their flanks. Imran Khan with this clever bowling has brought his opponent out of the crease. Imran Khan is the seasoned campaigner and a master of mind games. His biggest forte is his resilience and dogged determination. He can claw back from an impossibly difficult situation. His capacity to absorb pressure is superhuman. He is at its best when, under most strenuous stress. This unique gift of nature gives him a huge advantage over his opponents. Gen Bajwa is a  living testimony of this.. He underestimated Imran Khan, was knocked out, and is left licking his wounds. 
        Imran‚Äôs support base has stubbornly refused to leave him. Poll after poll and survey after survey, show his popularity soaring above the skies.. Clearly, the propaganda blitz hasn‚Äôt met with any success. No major desertion or revolt could be an engineered in PTI. More importantly, the collective conscience of the nation, and the intelligentsia, is coming round to the inescapable conclusion that Imran Khan and PTI are being subjected to gross injustice and unfairness. Imran Khan‚Äôs arrest from Islamabad High Court and it‚Äôs harrowing optics were disastrous. The judiciary at-large felt extremely humiliated, when boots trampled upon the sanctity of the court and vandalised the premises.  This is now being amply manifested in its decisions. 
       There is now damningly incriminating and incontrovertible evidence that the arson and destruction, wrought at various places, was actually planned and executed by the state and of the government of the day. The state is now openly and shamefacedly defying court orders and injunctions . The government parties are using extremely abusive and vitriolic language against the judges, tearing down the fabric of the state.They are a group of brain-dead people, who have no answers to the problems of Pakistan, and are an excess  baggage only.
     Imran‚Äôs major adversary is clearly a mismatch for him. He is a pygmy in front of a giant. He has, so far proved to be of  average intelligence, with no sense of history. He‚Äôs clearly standing on the wrong side of the aspirations of the people of Pakistan. He‚Äôs already shown himself to be a bundle of nerves. He seems to have lost his balance and  confidence. He is an amateur, faced with a battle hardened professional. He is reportedly, a compromised person. Imran Khan enjoys a clear high moral ground as opposed to his opponent. Imran Khan is complete repository of the confidence of his people.          (FROM A REVOLUTIONARY) Continued",
