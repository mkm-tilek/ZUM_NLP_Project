Bannedforlife69,"I believe the future looks like this:

- This summer there will be more race riots spurred on by a dying MSM looking for rage-clicks

- The ""war"" in Ukraine will drag on, destroying resources and funneling money back into the Military Industrial Complex.   As Orwell wrote in 1984, these wars serve a purpose of driving the economy.  The powers that be don't want them to end, they want us to get used to them, just like every war since the great depression.

- Summer 2024 will be BRUTAL for race riots.  Things will continue to grow and stew in the US leading up to the election.

-  Whichever side loses the US election will claim (right or wrong) the election was rigged.  This time around the ""January 6"" riot will come with real bloodshed on both sides.   If I had to pick I'd say the Republicans will win, but the left will become so violent that the Democrats will declare martial law and refuse to give up power and this will be the start of the civil war

- Once the US civil war is fully under way, Russia will make their final push into eastern Europe, possibly not stopping at rolling across the  Ukraine and China will finally have the US occupied and out of the way to invade Taiwan.

Obviously I don't have a crystal ball so I could be wildly off on all of these or just off on the timing and severity, but I feel like this is all very much real.

I don't know if there will be any nukes deployed.  I could see ""someone"" EMPing North America, especially in the middle of the US civil war.  I definitely see a lot of cyber attacks coming in the next couple of years though.

WeirdSeaUrchin,"At first, yeah.. In 2003 after we rolled the army and toppled the government, a civil war broke out.

Either fortunately or unfortunately (Debatable.. I personally think it was unfortunate), our military was ordered not to intervene. It got real bad.

Even after the civil war, Iranian proxy militias showed up. We were at least allowed to directly intervene against them.

Then fucking ISIS showed up.

Things are pretty stable now and Iraq is a legitimate democracy with separations of power and the rule of law. So I mean, there's that?

The idea that we intentionally went there and planned for all that to happen is completely false though. Guilty of incompetence at nation-building but definitely not guilty of the kind of savagery people accuse us of.",

LittleDsrtFlowr,"Honestly, no.
The whole thing has been pretty awful, unjust, and seemingly hopeless through & through.
Regardless of how things change, w/ the war basically over, Assad still remains so Syrians who opposed the regime are basically screwed.
And now the Arab states are reconciling & accepting Assad back into the fold, and its not clear what if any concessions they're getting frm Assad for it. (??) One thing they could demand is Assad guaranteeing they won't seek reprisal & revenge against refugees who return, but I don't know how that could be monitored or TRULY ensured once ppl were back inside Syria. Ya know? The regime has always been able to do whatever it wanted w/ impunity inside Syria. 😕

If a decade of conflict wasn't able to topple Assad, or win Syrians any freedom, then I don't think anyone in the region can. (And w/ Russia's protection they can't be touched by western powers either.)

It's such a sad shitty unfair situation for both Syrians & Turks.
For the Syrian refugees who are without anywhere to go thats safe & stable, more now than ever since the Arab states have decided to normalize w/ Assad... And for the Turkish ppl who've been shouldering a far larger share of the burden than anyone else, despite dealing w/ their own troubles & hardships.

Meanwhile, Assad & the Arab states seem to be coming out of it alright — despite the both sides being responsible for facilitating so much violence & destruction in the conflict, which many Syrians got caught in the middle of, or were displaced because of.

It looks like this is jst gonna end up being one of the unhappy endings that ppl unfortunately have to accept in real life. 😕

If Syrians can't stay in Turkey, and they aren't willing to risk returning to the regime, maybe the territory that Turkey controls in Syria is their best option..?? Maybe they can make something more for themselves, & for the future, there..??

I dont know.

Today:

💊 Provided medicine solutions to over 300 cases

We started with @WhatsApp + @telegram

This week we’ve reached a crucial milestone in our growth: 

I moved our data to a centralised database with the aim of making things easier for our hero-team of volunteers and streamlining our workflows with one goal in mind:

“Efficiently deliver humanitarian aid to as many people as possible”

📹 1: Sample of cases from our pharmacy department.

📹 2: List of pharmacies that has insulin, specific medications, etc. [compiled manually as we solved cases one-by-one]

📹 3: Medical needs SOS cases bird-eye view sorted by location, type of insulin in demand, etc. [this helps me predict where we would need “emergency kits” the most]

This is just the beginning - system will be “aesthetically pleasing” soon enough! 😅

Today:

💊 Provided medicine solutions to over 300 cases

We started with @WhatsApp + @telegram

This week we’ve reached a crucial milestone in our growth: 

I moved our data to a centralised database with the aim of making things easier for our hero-team of volunteers and streamlining our workflows with one goal in mind:

“Efficiently deliver humanitarian aid to as many people as possible”

📹 1: Sample of cases from our pharmacy department.

📹 2: List of pharmacies that has insulin, specific medications, etc.

📹 3: Medical needs SOS cases bird-eye view sorted by location, type of insulin in demand, etc. [this helps me predict where we would need “emergency kits” the most]

This is just the beginning - system will be “aesthetically pleasing” soon enough! 😅

The team and I don’t usually share our journey in public, but I think it’s time they truly get recognized for the monumental impact they have done on the ground in Sudan 🇸🇩

Despite the fact that we now control a small part of Bakhmut, the importance of its defense does not lose its relevance. This gives us the opportunity to enter the city in case of a change in the situation. And it will definitely happen.

We continue to advance on the flanks in the suburbs of Bakhmut and are actually approaching the capture of the city in a tactical encirclement. Thanks to this, we will be able to control all high-rise buildings occupied by the enemy and gradually destroy them. This deprives the enemy of control over the approaches to the city and gives us certain tactical advantages.

In the course of working with the commanders, we discussed in detail our actions and the procedure for destroying the enemy. Therefore, we continue the defense. The situation is difficult, but under control.",

If our budget STAYS THE SAME for the following year, it’s considered a budget CUT. 

Does that make sense? If we could make it on our current budget last year, we can certainly do the same THIS NEXT YEAR

There is a long list of fiscal waste that we as taxpayers pay for. I’ve seen it first hand.

When I was in the Navy (public affairs), in order for us to receive the same funding as the previous year, we were forced to buy things that we didn’t need in order to receive the same funding the next year.

So what did I do? Ordered a $700 office chair (not needed), buy dozens of expensive pens (not needed), and other ridiculous items.

As American taxpayers, we should be PISSED. The United States Government takes and takes from our paychecks for “taxes” and spends frivolously.
