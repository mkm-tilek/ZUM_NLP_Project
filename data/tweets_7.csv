AMLO, the Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has been denouncing and asking diplomatically and in the media, that the US stay away from Mexican politics and stop financing shock and coup movements in Politics and National Media, and as an example, he gives the USAID agency in Mexico, which through the American Embassy in Mexico has been financing shock groups that, disguised as political groups, meddle in the base projects of the Lopez Obrador six-year term, first meddling in the closure of the expensive Pe√±a Nieto's Airport, later sponsoring media that paints the image of AMLO as a 'communist and tyrant who only wants to subdue the people to fulfill his personal fantasies'.

It is clear that the US, with its Monroe doctrine, only tries to manipulate and redirect the course of the neighboring country, which as a backyard ""should only be led"" to where the 3-letter Agencies of the American government decide to lead it, for which reason social leaders such as AMLO meddles and breaks with the subjugation scheme of the backyard, to all of this, do the Americans know?

WHO WILL BE THE WINNER OF THIS BATTLE ROYALE ?

Agha Sorash Kashmiri
                      
                 He is at peace only, when he‚Äôs at war. He is a natural fighter . Imran khan is more likely to be the winner. Here is why?
 Battle Royale is a fight participated by more than two combatants. The last fighter standing, is declared the winner. 9th May, and the following few days, witnessed the state coming down hardest, with it‚Äôs full and fearsome might, on Imran Khan and the PTI. The shock and awe of this blitzkrieg was to ensure complete demolition of both. It is 11 long days, that have passed since. Imran Khan and his party have survived, albeit battered than bruised. Imran khan stood up in no time, dusting off his clothes,  regaining his balance. He even launched a counteroffensive,  announcing a public meeting the next day, forcing his opponents onto the defensive. There is no clear winner in this round, and that is the success of Imran Khan. He continues to be present in the ring and his being ready to carry on fighting is a very powerful message, not lost to his adversaries. Plan A has not worked. More importantly, nothing seems to be working.
     Pakistanis are transfixed by this captivating dual being fought in front of their eyes. There was an element of inevitability about this. For quite some time, the belligerents were sizing up each other and strengthening their flanks. Imran Khan with this clever bowling has brought his opponent out of the crease. Imran Khan is the seasoned campaigner and a master of mind games. His biggest forte is his resilience and dogged determination. He can claw back from an impossibly difficult situation. His capacity to absorb pressure is superhuman. He is at its best when, under most strenuous stress. This unique gift of nature gives him a huge advantage over his opponents. Gen Bajwa is a  living testimony of this.. He underestimated Imran Khan, was knocked out, and is left licking his wounds. 
        Imran‚Äôs support base has stubbornly refused to leave him. Poll after poll and survey after survey, show his popularity soaring above the skies.. Clearly, the propaganda blitz hasn‚Äôt met with any success. No major desertion or revolt could be an engineered in PTI. More importantly, the collective conscience of the nation, and the intelligentsia, is coming round to the inescapable conclusion that Imran Khan and PTI are being subjected to gross injustice and unfairness. Imran Khan‚Äôs arrest from Islamabad High Court and it‚Äôs harrowing optics were disastrous. The judiciary at-large felt extremely humiliated, when boots trampled upon the sanctity of the court and vandalised the premises.  This is now being amply manifested in its decisions. 
       There is now damningly incriminating and incontrovertible evidence that the arson and destruction, wrought at various places, was actually planned and executed by the state and of the government of the day. The state is now openly and shamefacedly defying court orders and injunctions . The government parties are using extremely abusive and vitriolic language against the judges, tearing down the fabric of the state.They are a group of brain-dead people, who have no answers to the problems of Pakistan, and are an excess  baggage only.
     Imran‚Äôs major adversary is clearly a mismatch for him. He is a pygmy in front of a giant. He has, so far proved to be of  average intelligence, with no sense of history. He‚Äôs clearly standing on the wrong side of the aspirations of the people of Pakistan. He‚Äôs already shown himself to be a bundle of nerves. He seems to have lost his balance and  confidence. He is an amateur, faced with a battle hardened professional. He is reportedly, a compromised person. Imran Khan enjoys a clear high moral ground as opposed to his opponent. Imran Khan is complete repository of the confidence of his people.          (FROM A REVOLUTIONARY) Continued",

WHO WILL BE THE WINNER OF THIS BATTLE ROYALE ?

Agha Sorash Kashmiri
                      
                 He is at peace only, when he‚Äôs at war. He is a natural fighter . Imran khan is more likely to be the winner. Here is why?
                Battle Royale is a fight participated by more than two combatants. The last fighter standing, is declared the winner. 9th May, and the following few days, witnessed the state coming down hardest, with it‚Äôs full and fearsome might, on Imran Khan and the PTI. The shock and awe of this blitzkrieg was to ensure complete demolition of both. It is 11 long days, that have passed since. Imran Khan and his party have survived, albeit battered than bruised. Imran khan stood up in no time, dusting off his clothes,  regaining his balance. He even launched a counteroffensive,  announcing a public meeting the next day, forcing his opponents onto the defensive. There is no clear winner in this round, and that is the success of Imran Khan. He continues to be present in the ring and his being ready to carry on fighting is a very powerful message, not lost to his adversaries. Plan A has not worked. More importantly, nothing seems to be working.
               Pakistanis are transfixed by this captivating dual being fought in front of their eyes. There was an element of inevitability about this. For quite some time, the belligerents were sizing up each other and strengthening their flanks. Imran Khan with this clever bowling has brought his opponent out of the crease. Imran Khan is the seasoned campaigner and a master of mind games. His biggest forte is his resilience and dogged determination. He can claw back from an impossibly difficult situation. His capacity to absorb pressure is superhuman. He is at its best when, under most strenuous stress. This unique gift of nature gives him a huge advantage over his opponents. Gen Bajwa is a  living testimony of this.. He underestimated Imran Khan, was knocked out, and is left licking his wounds. 
               Imran‚Äôs support base has stubbornly refused to leave him. Poll after poll and survey after survey, show his popularity soaring above the skies.. Clearly, the propaganda blitz hasn‚Äôt met with any success. No major desertion or revolt could be an engineered in PTI. More importantly, the collective conscience of the nation, and the intelligentsia, is coming round to the inescapable conclusion that Imran Khan and PTI are being subjected to gross injustice and unfairness. Imran Khan‚Äôs arrest from Islamabad High Court and it‚Äôs harrowing optics were disastrous. The judiciary at-large felt extremely humiliated, when boots trampled upon the sanctity of the court and vandalised the premises.  This is now being amply manifested in its decisions. 
 There is now damningly incriminating and incontrovertible evidence that the arson and destruction, wrought at various places, was actually planned and executed by the state and of the government of the day. The state is now openly and shamefacedly defying court orders and injunctions . The government parties are using extremely abusive and vitriolic language against the judges, tearing down the fabric of the state.They are a group of brain-dead people, who have no answers to the problems of Pakistan, and are an excess  baggage only.
             Imran‚Äôs major adversary is clearly a mismatch for him. He is a pygmy in front of a giant. He has, so far proved to be of  average intelligence, with no sense of history. He‚Äôs clearly standing on the wrong side of the aspirations of the people of Pakistan. He‚Äôs already shown himself to be a bundle of nerves. He seems to have lost his balance and  confidence. He is an amateur, faced with a battle hardened professional. He is reportedly, a compromised person. Imran Khan enjoys a clear high moral ground as opposed to his opponent. Imran Khan is complete repository of the confidence of his people.          (FROM A REVOLUTIONARY)Continued",

But remember- pple w/out modern conveniences prior to say 1940‚Äôs-50‚Äôs had to physically labor in fields & factories. Some of anxiety gets burned off when serotonin uptake happens naturally. But- they did suffer. 

Weird how after WW2 in the West/Europe etc, they ROLLED OUT ALL THE TECHNOLOGY TO GET PPL COMFORTABLE & COMPLIANT. Then made us fat, addicted to sugar, chemicals and video games.

THE UKRAINIAN MS. GOEBBELS

Lyudmila Denisova, former Ukrainian Ombudsman for human rights, nicknamed Ms. Goebbels, has been an official, main source of ''news'' from the war zone. She has been feeding the western media with fake stories of war crimes done by Russians as systematic rape/using rape as a weapon of war and other bizarre sexual atrocities

Here are a few of her false allegations:
- Rape of a 6 months old baby
- Rape of a one year old child to death
- Rape of a 11 year old boy, while forcing the mother to watch
- Rape of babushkas/very old women
-Russian soldiers holding many young women captive in basement, torturing, raping and impregnate them.

These and numerous other allegations of sick and perverse crimes plus ''normal'' war crimes as the Bucha story, mass graves and other made up stories.
All these stories have been eagerly published by western media with zero verification.
The Ukrainian government has now fired her for lying so badly, so over the top, that her stories became unbelievable even for Western media.

A member of the Ukrainian parliament said that one of the reasons was: ""..the numerous details of 'unnatural sexual offenses' and child sexual abuses in the occupied territories, which were unsupported by evidence and only harmed Ukraine.""

We can understand the magnitude, the scope of Ms. Goebbels lying when a Nazi regime in one of the worlds most corrupt countries becomes worried about their reputation!
The most sickening thing in this ordeal is Lyudmila Denisova's perversion of the truth as a Ombudsman, and the destruction of the very important position the work in a war zone as a human rights person.

 The US Fascist regime, the Empire of Lies, have trained their puppets well.
But Ukraine has not much credibility left after countless obviously fake atrocity stories.

üü† Follow our LIVE coverage: https://t.co/aSVnvezcZV https://t.co/FmnNLzrwAk",
VolodyaTretyak,"War criminal Girkin draws some conclusions from #Bakhmut battle. Shortly, it is a strategic failure. He says this situation is similar to the one in the last September when RU forces fought for Pisky village near Donetsk for months and then received a very painful Kharkiv counter-offensive.

Translation:

I already briefly expressed my opinion on the completion of the storming of Bakhmut yesterday in the ""trolley"". But, reading the foully happy comments on VKontakte, I thought that I should calmly and in detail go over this operation again, which now (in order to put ""Chef"" on the ""victory laurels"") is being hyped in every possible way.

So, in brief.

1. After humiliating and almost catastrophic autumn defeats in the Kharkiv region, first cutting of the Kherson bridgehead under the onslaught of the enemy, and then its complete abandonment - the Russian Armed Forces, by conducting a partial ""under-mobilization"" (as its legal status was completely unclear and it was limited to the draft of 250-300 thousand men and nothing else), tried during the winter campaign (which gradually turned into the spring campaign) ""to take revenge"" on the Donbas front. Precisely and only on the Donbas (Donetsk and Lugansk) front. Because even earlier (last spring - after the ""de-escalation"") the Kremlin adopted (and remains unchanged to this day) a policy of ""freezing the conflict through a compromise agreement with partners. And within the framework of ""achievement of this agreement"" no attacks deep into the so-called ""Ukraine"" are considered at all - whatever strategic prospects they may promise. Therefore, it is only a ""battle of attrition"" against the enemy's position in Donbass in the hope that ""sooner or later the partners will mature. The cretinism of this concept and its stillbornness are exceptional. But it is being implemented with the same sullenly idiotic stubbornness with which the same ""non-alternative Minsk agreements"" have been trying to be implemented for eight years. Since the end of April last year - all offensive operations of the Russian Armed Forces have been carried out ONLY in the Donbas. Even having occupied part of the Kharkiv region along the line of Seversky Donets, they were not going to advance west of it - they were exclusively driven to the south - to the most heavily fortified Slavyansk-Kramatorsk agglomeration. With the corresponding result...

2. In other words, starting the offensive in the Donbass late last fall, our ""military strategists"" were once again trying to solve for the political leadership the task that our elderly cretins had ""painted"" in their heads: ""To completely liberate the Donbass and start bargaining with Kyiv and dear Western partners to impose the ""status quo"": Crimea, Donbas and the Corridor to Crimea - for us, no more, we do not pretend.
As we can see, this task has not been solved even a little in seven months of bloody battles (in many areas - near Avdiivka and Marinka, for example, almost continuously).
And the fact that Wagner - which was supplied and replenished until the middle of winter this year. And the fact that during the months-long ""meat grinder"" Wagner, which had been supplied and reinforced with materiel until the middle of the winter, managed to ""win"" two small towns - Soledar and Bakhmut - is the only tactical victory. And in connection with the complete failure of the strategic task, the capture of Bakhmut is presented as ""the crown of the art of leadership"" and ""an epochal battle of world-historical significance.

3.Meanwhile - as noted above - on the whole the operation ended in strategic failure for our troops. The enemy was NOT dislodged from Donbas in all major directions, in most directions - not moved at all.
During the offensive the RF Armed Forces used up a lot of trained manpower, exhausted almost to the bottom the stockpiles of weapons, equipment and ammunition necessary for further offensive operations.
That's why Bakhmut was given increased attention for the last two months - it was necessary to achieve at least some result ""for propaganda"" in order to ""take a breath"" afterwards... So, like, we won... And yesterday we stopped right on the outskirts of Bakhmut, barely crawled up to it - no strength to go further ...

4. Now we should expect a ""reciprocal move"" from the enemy. Similar to the one made by the enemy in September, right after our valiant generals ""domesticated"" the tiny PGT Peski on the outskirts of Donetsk in a month.
Why do I think the enemy will attack soon? - Precisely because now he has the best chance to succeed. - The best strike units of the Russian Armed Forces are exhausted from months of fighting. Stocks of ammunition are minimal. If, for example, the enemy chooses to attack the Donetsk Front (for example, in the Mariupol direction), he will be met by units and subunits that are badly shattered and ""thinned out"" by redeployment of reserves to Bakhmut. And if it decides to attack on the Zaporizhzhia front, it will not have to worry about the stability of its defenses on the Slavyansko-Kramatorsky direction and near Avdeevka.

5. And therefore - I consider the victory at Bakhmut:
a) Inherently unnecessary (""diversion to an unfit object"", I wrote about it many times);
b) ""Pyrrhic"". It was not worth the effort and money spent on it, even approximately.

I HOPE TO BE WRONG.",['Bakhmut']

WHO WILL BE THE WINNER OF THIS BATTLE ROYALE ?

Agha Sorash Kashmiri
                      
                 He is at peace only, when he‚Äôs at war. He is a natural fighter . Imran khan is more likely to be the winner. Here is why?
                Battle Royale is a fight participated by more than two combatants. The last fighter standing, is declared the winner. 9th May, and the following few days, witnessed the state coming down hardest, with it‚Äôs full and fearsome might, on Imran Khan and the PTI. The shock and awe of this blitzkrieg was to ensure complete demolition of both. It is 11 long days, that have passed since. Imran Khan and his party have survived, albeit battered than bruised. Imran khan stood up in no time, dusting off his clothes,  regaining his balance. He even launched a counteroffensive,  announcing a public meeting the next day, forcing his opponents onto the defensive. There is no clear winner in this round, and that is the success of Imran Khan. He continues to be present in the ring and his being ready to carry on fighting is a very powerful message, not lost to his adversaries. Plan A has not worked. More importantly, nothing seems to be working.
               Pakistanis are transfixed by this captivating dual being fought in front of their eyes. There was an element of inevitability about this. For quite some time, the belligerents were sizing up each other and strengthening their flanks. Imran Khan with this clever bowling has brought his opponent out of the crease. Imran Khan is the seasoned campaigner and a master of mind games. His biggest forte is his resilience and dogged determination. He can claw back from an impossibly difficult situation. His capacity to absorb pressure is superhuman. He is at its best when, under most strenuous stress. This unique gift of nature gives him a huge advantage over his opponents. Gen Bajwa is a  living testimony of this.. He underestimated Imran Khan, was knocked out, and is left licking his wounds. 
               Imran‚Äôs support base has stubbornly refused to leave him. Poll after poll and survey after survey, show his popularity soaring above the skies.. Clearly, the propaganda blitz hasn‚Äôt met with any success. No major desertion or revolt could be an engineered in PTI. More importantly, the collective conscience of the nation, and the intelligentsia, is coming round to the inescapable conclusion that Imran Khan and PTI are being subjected to gross injustice and unfairness. Imran Khan‚Äôs arrest from Islamabad High Court and it‚Äôs harrowing optics were disastrous. The judiciary at-large felt extremely humiliated, when boots trampled upon the sanctity of the court and vandalised the premises.  This is now being amply manifested in its decisions. 
             There is now damningly incriminating and incontrovertible evidence that the arson and destruction, wrought at various places, was actually planned and executed by the state and of the government of the day. The state is now openly and shamefacedly defying court orders and injunctions . The government parties are using extremely abusive and vitriolic language against the judges, tearing down the fabric of the state.They are a group of brain-dead people, who have no answers to the problems of Pakistan, and are an excess  baggage only.
             Imran‚Äôs major adversary is clearly a mismatch for him. He is a pygmy in front of a giant. He has, so far proved to be of  average intelligence, with no sense of history. He‚Äôs clearly standing on the wrong side of the aspirations of the people of Pakistan. He‚Äôs already shown himself to be a bundle of nerves. He seems to have lost his balance and  confidence. He is an amateur, faced with a battle hardened professional. He is reportedly, a compromised person. Imran Khan enjoys a clear high moral ground as opposed to his opponent. Imran Khan is complete repository of the confidence of his people.          (FROM A REVOLUTIONARY) Continued",

Amin848299261,"WHO WILL BE THE WINNER OF THIS BATTLE ROYALE ?

Agha Sorash Kashmiri
                      
                 He is at peace only, when he‚Äôs at war. He is a natural fighter . Imran khan is more likely to be the winner. Here is why?
                Battle Royale is a fight participated by more than two combatants. The last fighter standing, is declared the winner. 9th May, and the following few days, witnessed the state coming down hardest, with it‚Äôs full and fearsome might, on Imran Khan and the PTI. The shock and awe of this blitzkrieg was to ensure complete demolition of both. It is 11 long days, that have passed since. Imran Khan and his party have survived, albeit battered than bruised. Imran khan stood up in no time, dusting off his clothes,  regaining his balance. He even launched a counteroffensive,  announcing a public meeting the next day, forcing his opponents onto the defensive. There is no clear winner in this round, and that is the success of Imran Khan. He continues to be present in the ring and his being ready to carry on fighting is a very powerful message, not lost to his adversaries. Plan A has not worked. More importantly, nothing seems to be working.
               Pakistanis are transfixed by this captivating dual being fought in front of their eyes. There was an element of inevitability about this. For quite some time, the belligerents were sizing up each other and strengthening their flanks. Imran Khan with this clever bowling has brought his opponent out of the crease. Imran Khan is the seasoned campaigner and a master of mind games. His biggest forte is his resilience and dogged determination. He can claw back from an impossibly difficult situation. His capacity to absorb pressure is superhuman. He is at its best when, under most strenuous stress. This unique gift of nature gives him a huge advantage over his opponents. Gen Bajwa is a  living testimony of this.. He underestimated Imran Khan, was knocked out, and is left licking his wounds. 
               Imran‚Äôs support base has stubbornly refused to leave him. Poll after poll and survey after survey, show his popularity soaring above the skies.. Clearly, the propaganda blitz hasn‚Äôt met with any success. No major desertion or revolt could be an engineered in PTI. More importantly, the collective conscience of the nation, and the intelligentsia, is coming round to the inescapable conclusion that Imran Khan and PTI are being subjected to gross injustice and unfairness. Imran Khan‚Äôs arrest from Islamabad High Court and it‚Äôs harrowing optics were disastrous. The judiciary at-large felt extremely humiliated, when boots trampled upon the sanctity of the court and vandalised the premises.  This is now being amply manifested in its decisions. 
             There is now damningly incriminating and incontrovertible evidence that the arson and destruction, wrought at various places, was actually planned and executed by the state and of the government of the day. The state is now openly and shamefacedly defying court orders and injunctions . The government parties are using extremely abusive and vitriolic language against the judges, tearing down the fabric of the state.They are a group of brain-dead people, who have no answers to the problems of Pakistan, and are an excess  baggage only.
             Imran‚Äôs major adversary is clearly a mismatch for him. He is a pygmy in front of a giant. He has, so far proved to be of  average intelligence, with no sense of history. He‚Äôs clearly standing on the wrong side of the aspirations of the people of Pakistan. He‚Äôs already shown himself to be a bundle of nerves. He seems to have lost his balance and  confidence. He is an amateur, faced with a battle hardened professional. He is reportedly, a compromised person. Imran Khan enjoys a clear high moral ground as opposed to his opponent. Imran Khan is complete repository of the confidence of his people. Imran Khan is more likely to be the last man left standing  in the ring.",
